*** Isis project ***

This set of c++ and python code constitute a tool to perform analysis in High Energy Physics. The environment is built executing the attached script "loadenv.sh".

The different tools have been tested under C++11, Python v2.7.8, ROOT v6.02 and Boost v1.61.

Part of this project depends on the Boost libraries http://www.boost.org/. In special code for c++ implementations to be used in python. It also depends on some python packages like numpy.

To install the package, first source the configuration file "configure.sh" typing ". configure.sh" or "source configure.sh". Then type "make" and the installation will start. In order to set the Isis environment create an alias to execute $ISIS/bin/loadenv.sh, for example "source $ISIS/bin/loadenv.sh".

The installation is done using cmake, so one can also create a proper installation directory. To see the avaliable options for the build process please read the < CMakeLists.txt > file.
